# This script converts a list of stimulus sentences into the format required for use with EyeTrack, part of the UMass software package written by Adrian Staub. (see http://www.psych.umass.edu/eyelab/software/). This is meant for use with the Eyelink 1000. 

# input: python eyetrack_reading.py 'input file'
# output: text file 'output.script' in same directory
	# to use output.script, open file from inside EyeTrack

# format for input file:

	(#) Experiment 1
	1a. 	Item 1, condition 1.
			(Y/N question? (Correct answer))
	1b. 	Item 1, condition 2. 
			(Y/N question? (Correct answer))
	.
	.
	2a.		Item 2, condition 1.
			(Y/N question? (Correct answer))
	2b.		Item 2, condition 2.
			(Y/N question? (Correct answer))
	.
	.
	((#) Experiment 2)
	""
	((#) Fillers)
	""
	((#) Practice)
	""

# Every section must start with a heading consisting of letters and spaces and optionally starting with a '#'. Your item set may have any number of experiments, as long as every experiment has the same number of conditions (required for EyeTrack to do Latin squaring). Section headings may be repeated within item sets (as in the Psyscope format) as long as they are identical. Besides experiment sections, you may have sections for 'Fillers' and 'Practice' items. Practice items will be run first in the order they're given. 

# Every reading item must start with an item number and a letter specifying the condition. Each item may optionally be followed by a Y/N comprehension question. Each question may optionally start with a '?' and may optionally be followed by the correct answer to the question: Y(es) or (N)o. If no answer is given it will default to 'Y'. (To reverse this, edit line 150.) Having questions after some items and not others is fine.

# Spacing across and within lines doesn't matter. Sections may be arranged in any order. The actual order of item numbers doesn't matter as long as all items within a block have the same number and you don't reuse item numbers within a given experiment section. This means you can add, delete, and rearrange item sets within having to renumber them. Periods after item number and condition letter (e.g. '1a.') aren't required but look nice. Case (upper vs. lower) doesn't matter anywhere. 

# Minimally stated, the formatting requirements are as follows:

		# Every section must have a header. 
		# The first word in filler and practice section headings must be 'filler'/'practice'
		# Every experiment section must have the same number of conditions. 
		# Each entry may only be one line.
		# Only reading items should start with the (number)(letter) identifier.
		# Questons must end with a '?'
		# Section headings may start with a '#' but otherwise should consist only of letters and spaces. 
		# Within a given experiment, there can't be two items with the same item number and condition. 

# The script will output names of experiments, number of conditions/experiment, number of fillers and practice items, and number of questions. If it finds a section without a heading or detects a different number of conditions in different experimental blocks, it will output an error.

# Experiment formatting and various other parameters have to be edited manually if you don't like the defaults.  

# NOTE: for reasons that are unclear, EyeTrack sometimes displays an experimental trial or two before the practice items. This is not a bug in the script.
#        
#
# ADDENDUM March 14 2017, Anton Malko:
#
# Added the possibility to specify input message by specifying one of two command line parameters:
# + --intro-file FILENAME (expects a file name containing one line with the intro message; new lines should be explicitly stated as \n)
# + --intro-text TEXT (expects a string with the intro message; again, new lines should be explicitly stated)
#
# Notice that the las line of the intro ("'Please press \'X\' to begin a practice session.\n'") is added by the script automatically (only in the case you actually have 
# practice items), so you don't need to add it to the text you feed to the script.
